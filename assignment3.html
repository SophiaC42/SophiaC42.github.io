            <p> An LED is blue when the thermal sensor is cold, and red when the thermal sensor is warmed up.</p> 
            <p> I used <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Calibration">Calibration</a> by Davit A. Mellis (2008) as a base for my code. </p> 
          
            <h2> The Schematics </h2>

            <p>
            I have a thermal sensor connected to a 100 ohm resistor and being read by the A0 pin. The multicolor LED has its red and blue LEDs connected to a 220 ohm resistor and 100 resistor, respectively. 
            <p> Voltage from arduino: 5 volts. LED voltage drop: 1.8 volts for red, and 3.3 for blue. Max current: 30 mA</p>
            <p>V=IR</p>
            <p>Red: Rmin = V/I = (5-1.8)/.03 = 106.67 ohm minimum resistance </p>
            <p>Blue: Rmin = V/I = (5 - 3.3)/.03 = 56.67ohm minimum resistance </p>
            <p>Therefore, the 220 ohm resistor for the red and the 100 ohm resistor for the blue is best!</p>
            <p>I like using the maximum current (30 mA) in my calculations, so I know without a doubt that any larger resistor is safe.</p>
            <p><p>
            <p> As for the thermal sensor, I decided that a 100 ohm resistor would be good, since I thought a large resistor limits the range of values. Even with a small resistor, I got values ranging from 7 to 12 when I checked my reading of the thermal sensor. if we take 10 to be the middle value, we can find the approximate resistance the thermal thermometer is giving out. don't forget that the thermal sensor output (a range of 0-1023) has to be converted to voltage (a range of 0-5). </p>
            <p>Vout = Vin (R2/(R1 + R2))</p>
            <p>10*(5/1023) = 5 (100/(R1 + 100)</p>
            <p>10/1023 = 100/(R1+100) </p>
            <p>10/1023 = 10/((R1 + 100)/10)</p>
            <p>1023 = (R1 + 100)/10</p>
            <p>10230 = R1 + 100</p>
            <p>10130 = R1 </p>
            <p><p>
            <p>Once I did the calculations, I realized that I made a logical error. Since R2 is so small in comparison to my resistor, the output value is also goign to be small, and going to have a limited range. If I used had used a resistor that had been closer, such as a 1K resistor, the range would have been larger, resulting in a smoother transition of lighting when the temperature changed. After all of my documentation, I changed out the 100 resistor for a 1000 resistor and got a significantly smoother transition. However, the 100 ohm resistor still worked.<p>

            <h2>The Wiring </h2>
            <p> <img src="A3_breadboard.jpg" width=400></a> </p>
            <p>For the thermal sensor, red connects to power, black to ground, and white is for reading values. For the light, the red wire connects to the red LED, and the blue wire connects to the blue LED, with black to ground.</p>

            <p>The thermal sensor reads just room temperature and the LED is blue. Then, when I touch the thermal sensor, it heats up, and the LED transitions to red.</p>
