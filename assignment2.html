            <h1>Assignment 2: Fade!</h1>
            <p> An LED goes through different actions whenever a button is pressed. The actions are: off, on, dim, and fade in and out. </p>

            I have a button connected to power, with a wire to pin 2 to read if it's on or off. The button is also connected to a 1000 ohm resistor, to that current isn't infinite and it doesn't drain too much pover. I also have a yellow LED connected to pin 9. It has a 220 ohm resistor. Here's the math:
            <p> Voltage from arduino: 5 volts. LED voltage drop: 1.8 volts. Max current: 30 mA</p>
            <p>V=IR</p>
            <p>5-1.8 = .03 * R </p>
            <p>R = 3.2/0.03 = 106.66 minimum resistor</p>
            <p>Therefore, the 220 ohm resistor is best!</p>
            <p>I like using the maximum current (30 mA) in my calculations, so I know without a doubt that any larger resistor is safe.</p

// constants that won't change. They're used here to set pin numbers and how many actions the LED will take:
const int buttonPin = 2;    // which port the pushbutton pin is
const int ledPin = 9;      // which port the LED pin is
const int actionMax = 3;     // how many actions the LED will take
unsigned long debounceDelay = 50;    // the debounce time, to make sure the button actually changed, instead of a mistake

// Variables that will change:
int ledAction = 0;             // tells which action the LED is taking
int buttonState;             // the latest reading of the button
int lastButtonState = LOW;   // the previous reading of the button, starts out off
unsigned long lastDebounceTime = 0;  // the last time the button changed

void setup() {
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT); //sets the button pin to read inputs
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);  //sets the ledPin to be an output

      buttonState = reading;                                // then update the button state.
      if (buttonState == HIGH) {                            // furthermore, if the button state is HIGH,
        ledAction +=1;                                      // then move on to the next LED action

    for (int fadeValue = 0 ; fadeValue <= 255 && check == 0; fadeValue += 5) { //fade from off to full on, as long as the button hasn't been pressed
      analogWrite(ledPin, fadeValue);     // sets the LED brightness (range from 0 to 255):
      check = digitalRead(buttonPin);     // check if the button has been pressed
      delay(30);                          // wait for 30 milliseconds, so the dimming happens at a rate we can see
    }

            <p>As I hit the button, the light changes. The order: Off, on, dim, and fading in and out. It then can be pressed to repeat the cycle</p>
