            <p>Talking to the web: I have a photoresistor that, as the light it percieves changes, it changes the color of the oval on my screen. Specifically it changes the greeness of the oval, with bright light making it a light green and low light making it a strong purple.</p>
            <p>The web talks back: When I press the key "2", it incrementally brightens my LED strip. when I press "1" it incrementally dims the LED strip</p>
            
            <p></p>

            <h2>The Schematic</h2>
            <img src="A5_schematic.jpg" width=400></a>
            I used the same circut as my last assignment, so that I could focus on the web connection. I connect up the LED strip to Vin, which will be 11.36 volt, then to the transistor, which is connected to pin 9 and ground. The photoresistor is connected to 5v, with a 100k ohm resistor, and A1 between them to read the voltage difference.
            <p></p>
                
            <h2>The Wiring </h2>
            <p> <img src="A6_breadboard.jpg" width=400></a></p>
            <p> Here's the breadboard! I'm using the mini breadboard as a test for my final project. Orange wires connect to 5 volts, red connects to the 12 volts, and blue connects to ground. </p>

      <h2>The Math (or general logic)</h2>
            <h3>Talking to the web</h3>
            <p>The line of communication for this goes: light -> photoresistor -> analogRead() value -> serial printed to the web -> rgb color range -> how green the elipse is</p>
            <p> When I looked up the range for the photoresistor last time, I found that darkness creates a resistance of 200k ohms, and bright light creates a resistance of 10k ohms. I want a wide range of sensing,, and last time I found that a number between the max and min of the photoresistor resistance works great. My Vout has a range of:</p>
             <p>Vout is between 5*100/(100+ 10) and 5* 100/(100+200) </p>
             <p>Vout is between 4.54 v and 1.66v/p>
             <p>That is converted to an analogRead range of 0-1023 and sent to the web. In the web, I want it to change the greeness of my oval, so I map and constrain to the rgb color range(0-255). </p>
             <p>When I first set this up, I sent that freshly converted value straigt to the rgb coloring. However, that created a violently flickering oval, that flashed beteween green and purple every update. Every other data value or so was coming up 0, which I think is from checking for serial communication and not getting any yet. I only want the color to be affected by nonzero values, so I set up an if statement filtering out 0 values. Then I made a value "green" that is seperate from the incoming data. green wants to be the same value as inData, but can only change up or down by a value of one each time. I did that because I like the slow transfer of color, and the steadiness of the color. </p>
            <h3>The Web Talks back:</h3>
            <p>This one is pretty simple. Any key I press is sent to the arduino. If the value sent is 49 or 50, the ASCII values of 1 and 2, then the LED strip brightens or dims. I used the increment of 10 as the increase and decrease values because it's noticible enough but the jumps arent too jarring. I also constrained the LED brightness variable to the valid range of 0 to 255. I often use constrain as a safety spot. Even if I'm sure the values shouldn't be beyond the needed range, it's always good to double check, especially when going out to the electric circut. </p>
            <p>One interesting thing I found was the need to return the computer value to 0. When I was first trying the setup out, when I pressed 2 the LED strip went fully on. I was confused and changed the step value to just one. When I reset and pressed 2 again, I saw the LED smoothly brighten to full. when I pressed 2, I made made the variable computer have the value of 50. Therefore, when passing through the main loop the arduino goes into the "if (computer == 50)" statement repeatedly untill I pressed a new key and changed computer. Since I only want the action to happen once, I added a line to change computer to 0 after every loop. I could have also put my if/else statements inside of the "if (Serial.available >0)" Statements, since that is only entered when a key is being pressed. </p>
