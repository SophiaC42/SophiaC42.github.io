            <p> A servo motor moves to the same angle a joystick is pointing</p> 
            <p> I used code from the slides about servo motors and joysticks as a base.</p> 
          
            <h2> The Schematics </h2>

            There were two items I needed to connect to my arduino: the joystick and the servo motor. Both needed 5 volts, but I only had one pin of 5volts. I decided to use pin 2 as another 5 volt output, by setting pin 2 to output, and setting it on high the whole time.

            <h2>The Wiring </h2>

            <p>Because of the way the joystick connects to a breadboard, I decided to use the mini breadboad. That way I wouldn't have to hold the entire breadboard sideways to use the joystick. I didn't need the button abilities of the joystick, so I didn't wire that up.</p>
            <p></p>
            
            
            <h2>The Math</h2>
            <p> <img src="A4_math.jpg" width=400></a> </p> 
            <p>The main challenge was converting the x and y values from the joystick to angles the servo motor could use. When the joystick is resting at neutral, x and y were in the 490s, which whas surprising considering the middle value between 0-1023 (the range of possible outputs) is 511. First, I shifted the x and y values so that the center values would be 0,0. I also had to flip the y value, because when the joystick pressed forward, y was smaller than the center, not bigger.With the values now centered, I could take the inverse tangent of y/x to get a value in radians. I then converted the angle into degrees: angle * 180 / PI. from there, we run into a different problem. inverse tangent only gives values between -90 - 90 degrees, and a negative value doesn't work for the servo. thats why, if the angle is negative, I changed it to 180 - 90. That final value could then be sent to the servo motor. </p>

            <h2>The Code </h2>
<pre>
int x = A0;           // Set up x values to come from A0
int y = A1;           // Set up y values to come from A1

// these values are doubles so that when I divide them later, that value is a double
double xval = 0;      // initialize x values
double yval = 0;      // initialize y values
int xcenter;          // Set up the x value when the joystick is neutral
int ycenter;          // Set up the y value when the joystick is neutral
double angle = 0;  // initialize the angle in radians
#include <Servo.h>    // include the servo library

Servo myServo;  // create a servo object


void setup() {
  myServo.attach(11);       // attaches the servo on pin 11 to the servo object
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);       // Set up pin 2 as an output
  digitalWrite(2 , HIGH);   // set pin 2 to HIGH, to be a 5 volt source for the joystick
  xcenter = analogRead(x);  // calibrate the joystick's neutral x value
  ycenter = analogRead(y);  // calibrate the joystick's neutral y value
 
}

void loop() {
  xval = analogRead(x) - xcenter;   //convert the x reading to a context where x-center is 0
  yval = ycenter - analogRead(y);   //convert the y reading to a context where y-center is 0,
                                    // and where pointing forward gets a positive value
  if(xval == 0) {               // the converted x value is 0,
    angle = PI / 2;          // then the radian angle is pi / 2 (to avoid a divide by 0 issue)
  } else {                      //otherwise,  
    angle = atan(yval/xval); //take the inverse tangent to find the angle in radians
  }
  angle = angle *180/ PI;   //convert the angle to degrees
  if(angle < 0){               //if the degree is negative
    angle = 180 + angle;    // convert it to an appropriate value
  }

  angle = constrain(angle,0,180); //just in case, make sure the angle is within the 0-180 bounds
  myServo.write(angle); //write the angle  to the servo
  delay(200);     //delay 200 milliseconds
}
